# Final Realm | Python Edition

Welcome to Final Realm, Python Edition!

This is a complete remake of the Final Realm game by Brian. It aims to bring
the best of Object Oriented Programming to the table and provide easier code
to develop and work with. The look and feel will be a little different compared
to the original game, but it will provide many of the same features, as well
as many new ones!
